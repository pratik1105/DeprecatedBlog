Choices are the luxury of the best.  
Choices are the seeds of unrest.  

Choices open windows and doors.  
Choices keep us spinning on our toes.  

Choices put us in a position of power.  
Choices leave such a nasty scar.  

Choices color our future with shades of bright.  
Choices splash regret on our hindsight.  

Choices enable us to move out of a dump.  
Choices enable us to elect Mr. Trump.  

Choices bring out the best in us.  
Choices bring out the worst in us.
