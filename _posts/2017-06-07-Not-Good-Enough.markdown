He was 18 years old  
when he was told  
"you are not good enough".  

Sure, the words wore masks,  
hoping they won't be identified  
But they so badly reeked of pain that  
it did not help, no matter how hard they tried.  

He was sure it must have been his own fault.  
Maybe he shouldn't have so deeply cared.  
Maybe he shouldn't have so unreservedly shared.  
Maybe he shouldn't have so unabashedly dared.  
or  
Maybe this was always where it was heading,  
and he should have been better prepared.  
Well not that it matters but,  
now, he's just plain old scared.
