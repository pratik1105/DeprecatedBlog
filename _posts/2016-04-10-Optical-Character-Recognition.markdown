This was a simple project done in association with Programming Club at IIT Kanpur where we implemented a Convolutional Neural Network with softmax regression using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), Google's Machine learning library , for classification of handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. 

This was one of my earliest projects and due to my lack of awareness of Github at the time, there is no proper documentation available on this project.  
However, the Tensorflow website maintains a tutorial for this very project. You could check that out to find out more.
