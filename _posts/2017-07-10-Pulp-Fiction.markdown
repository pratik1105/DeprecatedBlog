Follow me to the top of the mountain  
and then jump with me.  
Follow me to the depths of the ocean  
and let the sharks see.  

Let's be forty and twenty at the same time  
Let's make symphonies and be partners in crime.  
Let us lose inhibitions and let down our guards  
Let's exchange dreams like they're business cards.  

Let's discuss paradoxes and consequences of time travel  
Let's get some popcorn and watch mysteries unravel.  
Let's make mistakes every hour of every day  
Let's forget black or white and color our thoughts grey.  

Let's be vagabonds in some faraway lands  
and collapse into each other while the universe expands.  
Heck, let's even be thrown into some favela in Brazil  
But lets never be alone and forever refuse to stand still.
